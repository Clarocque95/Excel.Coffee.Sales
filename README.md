This is a Microsoft Excel project in which I created an interactive and dynamic dashboard showing interesting KPI's using mock coffee sales data.

This project helped me improve my skills in MS Excel using functions such as XLOOKUP, INDEX and IF statements. 

I also practiced creating pivot tables and interesting data visualizations. 

Finally, I refined my dashboarding skills and created appropriate filters and slicers that provided useful insights.
